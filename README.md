# Trace Archive
This repository contains traces of various real-world infrastructures, obtained from  our partners and collaborators, or obtained from open-source resources. Each trace is stored in a separate directory and contains the trace and a Jupyter notebook, used for the analysis of the trace.

This repository is work in progress, rapidly evolving, and we are continuously adding new traces.
